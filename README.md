build an AI that can be integrated into the Logseq UI, that uses #Logseq discourse (hub.logseq.com, discuss.logseq.com, and perhaps discord logs from the Logseq discord server) as context. This could be helpful for anything from keybinds to queries, as well as to developers for developing scripts, etc.
