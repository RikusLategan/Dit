# Dit
Build an AI that might later be integrated into the Logseq UI. This AI should utilize the #Logseq discourse (hub.logseq.com, discuss.logseq.com, and possibly discord logs from the Logseq discord server) as context. This AI could be useful for simple and complex tasks, such as keybinding, querying, scripting, plugin development, and more. This project will be both productive and enjoyable.
